# Library of Ruina Fansite: Next.js Version

A fan website for indie game [Library of Ruina](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1256670/Library_Of_Ruina/).
Remake of the [original fansite](https://github.com/Anurav-Garg/LoRFansite), using Next.js, with several additional features.

Most functional deployment of the site: <https://fansite-of-ruina-anurav-garg.vercel.app/>

Pretty much all assets used are from the game itself.
